# Home Assignment for Swedbank Frontend Developer Position

Task was to create a simple yet interactive application form for any bank's product such as
credit card, small loan, car leasing etc. Assignment purpose is to demonstrate frontend skills rather than to build a fully working application with backend and data handling. Therefore I decided to use React, in order to take an advantage of modularization and custom hooks.

Project consists three parts: introduction, questions and summary part. Introduction is just a short call-to action page. Questions are divided into five separate sections with various input types eg. dropdown, radio buttons, checboxes, textarea, text field - all the data is stored on frontend, which means that the user can move back and forth without of the fear of losing any filled information. All answers are mandatory, one moves to the next question block only after answering the previous one. In the summary page all the questions and the answers are displayed and they update dynamically.



## Running App

Clone the project or download as a zip-file, import all the files into desired dev environement eg. VCode, select the project directory and run in terminal: **npm i**. It installs all the modules that are listed on package.json file and their dependencies. For next run **npm start** which opens the app in the development mode, to view it open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in the browser.
